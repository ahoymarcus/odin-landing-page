                <p class="testimonial-section__text">The DevOps is a combination of two words, one is software Development, and second is Operations. This allows a single team to handle the entire application lifecycle, from development to testing, deployment, and operations. DevOps helps you to reduce the disconnection between software developers, quality assurance (QA) engineers, and system administrators. DevOps promotes collaboration between Development and Operations team to deploy code to production faster in an automated & repeatable way. </p>
